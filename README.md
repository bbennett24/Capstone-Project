# Capstone-Project
For the captone project I will be working with Camden Ransdel. Cam and I came up with what we think is a pretty cool idea. We are planning on making an automatic sandwhich making machine! We have created some diagrams and worked through a few of the issues that come with this callenge. There will be multiple options for the different sandwhich that the user would want. For example, 2 different types of meat, 2 different types of cheese, 2 different types of bread, and 2 different types of sauce. Once the user inputs their desires, the machine will get to work. By starting off with some bread, it will then slap on all of the ingredients. After topping off with another peice of bread, the user will then be able to open up the machine and grab their sandwhich and enjoy!
